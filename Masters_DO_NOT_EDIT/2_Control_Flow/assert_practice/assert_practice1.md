# sorta_sum
Define the function `sorta_sum(a,b)` such that given 2 positive ints, a and b, return their sum. However, sums in the range 10..19 inclusive, are forbidden, so in that case just return 20. 

* Define the function with appropriate style, preconditions.
* Validate with assert statements


### Example results
```
sorta_sum(3, 4) → 7
sorta_sum(9, 4) → 20
sorta_sum(10, 11) → 21
```
